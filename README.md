# Project-Demo
A demo folder for the course project

## The Repository should contain

### Add latex slides for the presentation containing the following details:

1. Video of the result (<=1 minute)
2. Motivation for choosing the system to demonstrate controls or controls to demonstrate on the chosen system (<= 2 minutes)
3. Formulation of the dynamics for the chosen system (<= 40 seconds)
4. Controller formulation and analysis (<=3 minutes)
5. Plots (<= 1 minute)
6. Questions (Subjective)

This is a timed task and the overall duration of the presentation should not exceed 12 minutes.

### Add well commented code ignoring environment and setup files

Submissions will be accepted only if done in Python/ MATLAB

Note: Grading weightage is as follows - (Environment/Robot Task + Dynamics & Controller Selection(10%) + Video(30%) + Plots(30%) + Questions(20%) + Presentation(10%))
