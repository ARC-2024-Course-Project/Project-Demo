# Project-Demo
A demo folder for the course project

## The Repository should contain

### Add PDF slides for the presentation containing the following details:

1. Video of the result (<=1 minute)
2. Motivation for choosing the system to demonstrate controls or controls to demonstrate on the chosen system (<= 2 minutes)
3. Formulation of the dynamics for the chosen system and representation in EL format(<= 40 seconds)
4. Controller formulation and analysis (<=3 minutes)
5. Plots (<= 1 minute)
6. Questions (Subjective)

This is a timed task and the overall duration of the presentation should not exceed 12 minutes.

Note that slides must be less than 14 MB

### Add well commented code ignoring environment and setup files

Submissions will be accepted only if done in Python/ MATLAB

Note: Grading weightage is as follows - (Environment/Robot Task + Dynamics & Controller Selection(10%) + Video(30%) + Plots(30%) + Questions(20%) + Presentation(10%))

Possible Robot Environments:
- [2D Drone](https://cookierobotics.com/052/)
- [3D Drone](https://github.com/arachakonda/gym-quad/tree/dfa9f2266cd503f2ce61ff13b00e70b3d194ffbd)
- Manipulator - ROS Gazebo (or) [Manipulator Simulation](https://github.com/arachakonda/SIMULATIONS/tree/main/mujoco_exploration/sessions/4_controls_and_trajectory_tracking)
- Mobile Robot - ROS Gazebo

Possible Trajectories:

- Straight line in the robot task space
- Circle in the robot workspace
- Cubic or Quintic Spline
- Lemniscate in the robot configuration space
- Double Lemniscate in the robot configuration space

Important deliverables for videos and plots:

- Regulation experiment using the robots mentioned above. Any other robot is also entertained!
- Joint Space Tracking experiment for the same
- Cartesian Space Tracking experiment using one of the above possible trajectory formats


### README File describing the folder structure (should also contain the links to the videoson onedrive)
